# ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS

   As engineers, and just as importantly, as professionals, we have an obligation to adhere to our responsibilities. In addition, we must ensure that we do 
  so in an ethical manner. This applies to all engineering projects within all engineering groups within all engineering companies within all engineering 
  fields. This of course includes our little group of software and electrical engineers within our little CMPE 131 class. For this project, we will be 
  constructing a simple email client capable of sending messages and having a to-do list. For our web application, we each have a set of responsibilities. 
  As professionals, it is our duty to satisfy these tasks ethically. An example of an ethical responsibility for our web application would be ensuring that
  our users' information such as the username and password does not get leaked within our web application. Additionally, we must construct a functional web    application capable of carrying out its functional and non-functional requirements in a reasonable time. We must work together to  ensure our final product is    
  satisfactory, and nothing less. We must make sure to help each other out when needed. And of course, we must be able to do so on our own. Obviously we may
  refer to the  class material for help, and sometimes we may feel the need to ask internet forums. But as professionals, we will never plagiarize someone 
  else’s code in any manner. To do so would breach the very ethical professionalism we stand for. 
  
   Engineering solutions to problems, such as our problem of creating a web app, come in many sizes. Some big and some small. The impact, however, can 
  sometimes be impossible to measure. Our project will most likely have little impact in terms of the global scale, but there are many engineering 
  solutions who seem to have surpassed such a scale. Many engineering solutions throughout time have made impacts in all kinds of aspects - economical, 
  environmental, and societal- that have changed the world we live in, for better or worse. Some solutions improve societies and sometimes society as a 
  whole. Take for instance, water purification. This solution has provided countless families with clean drinking water, something though impossible a 
  couple hundred years ago. Even household appliances have made our lives easier. There have been solutions that impact us economically, like LED light
  bulbs. This invention has made the price of electricity decrease dramatically, and by doing so has relieved many families of stress and financial 
  burden.  And environmental impacts? I could write a 100-page essay about every single one. But for fun, I’ll name two: solar panels and gas-powered 
  cars. Solar panels provide millions of homes with energy and electricity, harnessing energy from the sun without harming our planet. Gas-powered cars 
  on the other hand, have done detrimental damage to our home, despite the positive effects it has created for our society as means of transportation. 
    
   To summarize, engineering solutions can have positive and negative impacts on our world. Such solutions adhere to professional and ethical 
  responsiblities. Therefore, as engineers ourselves, we must adhere to the same criteria.
